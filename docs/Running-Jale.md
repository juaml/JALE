# Running Jale

After installing JALE you can run an ALE directly from your command line using the following command:

```bash
python -m jale /path/to/your/yaml/file.yml
```

If you need help finding the exact path of your project folder please navigate to your folder using the `cd` command and the enter `pwd`. This will print your current working directory. 

When running this command for the first time in a new virtual python environment it can take a minute or two till you see your first output.
If everything is working correctly your output should look something like this:
