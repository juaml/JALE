JALE will require you to have a project folder somewhere containing three seperate files:

1. Excel file containing experiment data (Author, Subjects, Coordinates, Tags)
2. Excel file containing information about the analyses to be run (Type of ALE, Tags to be included)
3. Yaml config file (specifying filenames and ALE parameters)

To download an example project folder please click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LenFrahm/JALE/master/jale/assets/examples.zip).

When filling out the files with your own data please make sure to follow the instructions provided in the following wiki pages. The algorithm is very sensitive to mistakes made in these files and even though there are a lot of failsafes and checks included we cannot catch all mistakes.
