# Output

JALE will create two new folders in your project folder:

## Results folder

This folder will contain all relevant resulting files from your ALE analyses

## **Folder Details**

#### **`Results/MainEffect/`**
- **`Volumes/`**:
  - Stores thresholded and unthresholded Nifti-Files for all relevant statistics (ALE, Z, TFCE).
- **`Contribution/`**:
  - Holds contribution files for MainEffect results. These contribution files allow for detailed analysis of significant clusters of convergence. Please see the [Contribution](Contribution) wiki page for more information on the structure of this file.
- **`NullDistributions/`**:
  - Stores null distributions computed by non-linear histogram integration and Monte Carlo simulation. These are not human-readable and are only used for quicker recomputation of an effect.
- **`Figures/`**:
  - Contains visual representations of results, including statistical maps and plots.

#### **`Results/Probabilistic/`**
- **`Volumes/`**:
  - Stores the averaged ALE maps for each probabilistic ALE analysis.
- **`NullDistributions/`**:
  - Contains null distributions for the probabilistic ALE. These are not human-readable and are only used for quicker recomputation of an effect.
- **`Figures/`**:
  - Contains visual representations of results, such as probability maps and analysis summaries.

#### **`Results/Contrast/`**
- **`Volumes/`**:
  - Stores thresholded contrast results for ALE analyses.
- **`NullDistributions/`**:
  - Stores null distributions for contrast analysis. These are not human-readable and are only used for quicker recomputation.
- **`Figures/`**:
  - Contains visual representations of results, including contrast maps and plots.

#### **`Results/BalancedContrast/`**
- **`Volumes/`**:
  - Stores thresholded results for balanced contrast analysis.
- **`NullDistributions/`**:
  - Stores null distributions for balanced contrast analysis. These are not human-readable and are only used for quicker recomputation.
- **`Figures/`**:
  - Contains visual representations of results, including balanced contrast maps and plots.

#### **`Results/MA_Clustering/`**
- Stores results for MA Clustering analyses.

## Logs folder

The `logs` folder contains text files with output generated by the ALE algorithm. These files are named using the date and time of the analysis run:
`(Year)(Month)(Day)_(Hour)(Minute).log`
